Assumption:
    - used http request to trigger an update
    - used docker so that it runs everywhere
    - exposed and used 8080 port for the app
    - created endpoints to update second, minute and hour messages

Requirement:
    - docker

How to run program:
    1. create docker image:-    docker build -t clock .
    2. execution:-              docker run -p 8080:8080 clock
    3. update messages for second hour and minutes, please use following endpoints
            to update second message - localhost:8080/secondmessage/quack
            to update minute message - localhost:8080/minutemessage/quack
            to update hour message - localhost:8080/hourmessage/quack

    4. you can change the execution cycle of the program by updating cli flags in dockerfile
        Dockerfile/line11: CMD ./tickerclock -secPMin=3 -secPHour=9 -deadline=18 -allowUpdate=10
        so in this clock minute is of 3 second and hour is of 9 seconds. Clock ends in 18 seconds
        and you can start updating clock message after 10 seconds

    5. stop container once done testing in between execution, use "docker ps" to get container name,
       then use "docker stop containername"

       
Thanks.
